[WARNING]
====
It is recommended that you NOT open this with Excel, which will wreak havoc upon the date examples.
====

If you must use Excel, open a blank Excel document and import this CSV into it making sure you import all the columns as text.

The freely available OpenOffice Calc is less destructively "helpful" when working with data files, though it is still recommended that you specify to treat all columns as text when opening.
